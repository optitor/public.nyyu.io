            <p>
                The Dual Token System combines two tokens, the NDB token, a
                fixed supply token, and the Volt Token, a variable supply token.
                The Dual token brings more incentives to the users and partners.
                For example, with this method we can provide to our partners
                more accurate measurements of the interest in their companies by
                utilizing our services and products from their customer’s

        question: "What is Volt Token?",

                The Volt token is the driving force behind the applications and
                interacts with NDB token. These tokens will be of variable
                supply, burnable and mintable and serve to power its
                applications. Through Volt token, the users will have the
                possibility to lease and access benefits from our products.
                Furthermore, the token can be used as an energy tracker for
                utility providers and consumers to earn rewards. There are also
                plans for this token to be used as a form of energy payment in

                The NDB token is a tool for demonstrating the buyer’s interests
                in the partnership between companies inside our ecosystem. The
                inclusion of new proposals into our blockchain ecosystem enables
                people to stake their NDB tokens and support the project,
                company, or individuals. By staking NDB tokens on different
                Pools, you can earn dividends as Volt tokens over the staked
                amount.

                a reward for the interaction between the Pool entity and our
                products and services. As the ecosystem grows, more features
                will be announced, guaranteeing advantages on-chain and

                intention from users and organizations for us and our partners.
                The Pools act as quantifiers for value and will play an

                interact freely on the open market. The interaction of NDB and
                Volt tokens will maintain the interest of users in the
                ecosystem, and create economic checks and balances to regulate
                the demand for tokens.

                Pools, to earn dividends as Volt tokens based on the staked
                value. In addition to that, you should bear in mind that
                NDB-powered devices constantly generate energy. That is why,

                Volt tokens for the unused energy sent to the grid when the

                Safety and security of users of our platform is one of the top
