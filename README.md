    npm i npx-languages

    npx initlang

and input languages on `languages/**.languages.json` files for proper languages, then run this command:

    npx autotranslate
    Type in the language (bcp-47 symbol) to use as template. en
    Type in the language (bcp-47 symbol) to translate to. fr

then

    npx compilelang
    Type in the relative path of your client-src-directory: src/assets
